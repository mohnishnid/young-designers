              Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT). In 1987, he was appointed
              Professor and Director, and then Dean of ID.
            </p>
            <p>

              During his leadership of ID, the school created the first PhD
              program in design in the USA, transformed ID into a leading
              institution in design methods and theory, and created an executive
              education program translating design to organizational leadership.
            </p>

              Prof. Whitney is widely regarded as a thought leader for
              pioneering the notions of humancentred design and strategic

              members of the ‘E-Gang’ for his work in human centred design; Fast
              Company has identified him as a ‘master of design’ for his
              leadership in the design field of linking the creation of value

              Entrepreneur Magazine named him one of 25 people worldwide doing
              the most to bring new ideas to business in China.
            </p>
            <p>
              Prof. Whitney has a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Visual Communication

              Currently, at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, he
              looks to bring design methods to this school and his work focuses
              on the behavioural side of health.
